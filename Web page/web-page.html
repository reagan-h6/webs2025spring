<center><p style="font-size:1.7vw;"> Hello! My name is Fabiola Wah Figueroa and I&#39;m a rising Junior at the University of Pittsburgh. I&#39;m pursuing a Chemistry major with a Neuroscience minor. This summer I spent four weeks in Austria and Slovenia on the Comparative Healthcare in Graz study abroad program alongside 23 of my classmates and our professor Orin James. This webpage serves as a way to document our experiences and demonstrate what we learned during our time abroad. </p><center>

<h1 style="font-size:3vw;">Why should students study abroad?</h1>

<p style="font-size:1.7vw;">Students should study abroad as it provides them with a different view of the world and the events surrounding them. It allows students to obtain new cultural knowledge and experience that wouldn&#39;t be available to them from their regular classes at their institutions. You also get a chance to meet other colleagues that have similar experiences as you and might be able to guide you and help you with your career goals.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:3vw;">What have you uncovered as it relates to your studies?</h1>

<center><p style="font-size:1.7vw">I uncovered that even though the countries I visited are very different from my home country, they are plagued by many of the same healthcare struggles we are going through at the moment. From not having enough healthcare workers to homelessness and problems with housing. Although affected by similar issues the way they are handled are very different as Austrians seem to handle issues with less of a capitalist point of view. For example, themes like homelessness are treated with much more empathy in Austria than the United States as they provide them with possible housing and refuge no matter their past, whereas in the U.S. they would likely be judge by their past mistakes and be provided with less help. Understanding these differences are key to identifying how to make America&#39;s healthcare system better and equal for as many people as possible.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:3vw;">How will you use this experience in your career?</h1>

<center><p style="font-size:1.7vw">This experience provided with many new ideas I&#39;d want to implement back home and a new perspective on European life and our cultural differences. From now on I will be more observant of my surroundings and see in which small ways our healthcare system is reflected in our everyday lives. I also wish to take this new knowledge and ideas and try to implement them in small ways back home. Ideas such as trying to make all the walk-signs in Pittsburgh have a constant ticking noise instead of having to press a button for it to work to facilitate commuting for those with sight impairments. Additionally, put forward requests for in campus organizations like the bike cave to create accessible bikes for those who use wheelchairs or are unable to ride a standard bicycle.
Most importantly I will take this sense of caring, and empathy shown by Austrians in everything they do and everyone they care for and implement it in my future career.</p>
