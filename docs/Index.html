          <div class= "content">
            <p class="indent">Welcome to the molecularly speaking blog page where we survey students all over the US to find students who have promise in STEM fields. This years 2025 pick for young successful scholar is Reagan Hamilton from the University of Pittsburgh! She has shown initiative in both ecology and sustainability working in labs, conducting research, and solving problems. You can use this website as a tool to learn all about her and explore some of her research. We hope her story will inspire you to continue your own!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="indent"> Reagan's most recent experiment in the turcotte lab is what made her stand out. She dedicated her time in the lab to measuring the root length of <em>Spirodela polyrhiza</em> and <em>Lemna Minor</em> two diploid duckweed species. These specimen are a result of an experiment that took place in 2023 a the PLE summer program supervised by Trappper Hobble. After periods of observation it was finally time to take measurements on over 600 images and currently Reagan has measured over 500 roots! She has partnered with Heather Dougherty to complete these measurments by the end of the 2025 spring semester so that the paper can be published by the end of the year. We have added some examples of these processed photos in the works section so head over there and check them out. </p>
