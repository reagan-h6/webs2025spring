    <h2 class="indent"><strong>About Reagan</strong></h2>
    <h3 class="indent"> Early Life </h3>
    <p class="indent"> Reagan began her academic career in the hidden valleys of Vernon, NJ where she attended Vernon Township High school. She was an active member of the community, volunteering for local organizations such PAL where she was a camp conselor and VTYS where she coached a U8 girls and boys soccer team. She graduated with honor and in the top 10% of her class, with an impressive transcript behind her she was ready to begin her college journey. She was thrilled to be accepted into the University of Pittsburgh where she planned to spend her undergraduate years. In an interview with Reagan she described Pitt as "the obvious choice" as soon as she stepped on the campus for the first time.</p>
    <h3 class="indent"> College experience </h3>
    <p class="indent"> Her first semester at Pitt she rushed to join clubs that interested her, she spent most her time volunteering with students for sustainability and playing with the Pitt club soccer team. She set her studeies to acheiving a major in Biology, with a minor in environmental engineering and certificate in sustainability. Her first introduction to her love for research came when she became a undergraduate teaching assistant (UTA) for the duckweed survivor lab. She got to mentor students and have hands on behind the scenes experience in research. Her next steps were to apply to the Turcotte Duckweed Lab that worked with the very same duckweed she helped students learn about as a UTA. This new research assistant position tested her learning and teamwork skills, having to adapt quickley to assisting on new projects each day and balancing a classes along with lab work. Although she was sussesful in becoming apart of graduate student Trapper Hobble's coesistance project. Reagan spent countless hours measuring root length for varying duckweed species so that it could be uses in Trapper's papper.</p>
    <h3 class="indent"> Future goals </h3>
    <p class="indent"> When we asked Reagan about where she saw herself in the future and she described it "a job where I can apply both my love for animals and improving the sustainability of society while traveling to new places". She plans on taking her skills to the west coast hopefully landing a job on the beaches of southern California. But for now she has just accepted an offer to work as a research assistant in the Industrial Engineering department working on making solar panels more recycable at their end of life. This job will see her through the rest of her college experience and the summer following graduation while she job searches. We hope to see her prosper in her future endevours and will gain new exposure in research. </p>
