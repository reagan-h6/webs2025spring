    <h2 class="indent"><strong>About Reagan</strong></h2>
    <h3 class="indent"> Early Life </h3>
    <p class="indent">Reagan began her academic journey in the hidden valleys of Vernon, NJ, where she attended Vernon Township High School. She was an active member of the community, volunteering with local organizations such as PAL, where she worked as a camp counselor, and VTYS, where she coached a U8 co-ed soccer team. She graduated with honors and ranked in the top 10% of her class. With an impressive transcript behind her, she was ready to begin her college journey. Reagan was thrilled to be accepted into the University of Pittsburgh, where she planned to spend her undergraduate years. In an interview, she described Pitt as “the obvious choice” from the moment she first stepped onto campus.</p> 
    <h3 class="indent">College Experience</h3>
    <p class="indent">During her first semester at Pitt, Reagan quickly immersed herself in campus life, joining clubs that aligned with her interests. She spent much of her time volunteering with Students for Sustainability and playing on the Pitt Club Soccer team. She set her academic sights on earning a major in Biology, a minor in Environmental Engineering, and a certificate in Sustainability. Her passion for research began when she became an undergraduate teaching assistant (UTA) for the Duckweed Survivor Lab. There, she mentored students and gained valuable behind-the-scenes experience in scientific research. This role led her to apply to the Turcotte Duckweed Lab, which worked with the very same duckweed she had helped teach students about as a UTA. As a research assistant, Reagan honed her teamwork and adaptability, juggling multiple projects while maintaining her coursework. She eventually became a key contributor to graduate student Trapper Hobble’s coexistence project, spending countless hours measuring root lengths of various duckweed species for use in Trapper’s publication.

    <h3 class="indent">Future Goals</h3>
    <p class="indent">When asked about her future, Reagan said she envisions “a job where I can apply both my love for animals and improving the sustainability of society while traveling to new places.” She hopes to bring her skills to the West Coast and eventually land a position on the beaches of Southern California. In the meantime, she has accepted a position as a research assistant in the Industrial Engineering Department, where she will be working on making solar panels more recyclable at the end of their lifecycle. This role will support her through the remainder of college and the summer after graduation as she searches for her next opportunity. We look forward to seeing Reagan thrive in her future endeavors and continue to gain valuable research experience.</p>
